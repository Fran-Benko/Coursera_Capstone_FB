Buenos Aires Neighborhood Analysis by Franco Benko

Introduction/Business Problem

My project consists of performing an analysis of each neighborhood of my city Capital Federal. 
The analysis aims to understand which are the actual venue's frequency and train a clustering model for identifing 
similar neighborhoods. 

Data section

About the data, I apply web scrapping to get the name of the Buenos Aires neighborhoods and it's geological coordinates.
Then I am going to use that coordinates to get the information of the venues from the Foursquare API and analyze it.
